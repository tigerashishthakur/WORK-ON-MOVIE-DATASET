# WORK-ON-MOVIE-DATASET
 
 
 In this project, i worked on dataset using pandas and matplotlib.
 For my project, i downloaded "movie_metadata.csv" from kaggle and did the exploration
 this project is just a practice on data ANALYSIS at beginner level.



here, i plotted the scatter graph where my x-axis was the "length of movie_title" and where my y-axis was "no. of times i have a movie with same length of movie title"
